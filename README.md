# Design of 4KB Static RAM 1.8V (access time &lt;2.5ns) using OpenRAM and Sky130 node 
The work presented here is the design of Static RAM memory of 1024 x 32 (4Kb) with less than 2.5ns access time using OpenRAM compiler and Sky130 technology node.
Custom cells required for SRAM are designed and simulated in "ngspice". Schematics are created with "xschem" circuit editor.
